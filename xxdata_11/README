ADAS Fortran subroutine: xxdata_11
----------------------------------

Purpose:

A fortran subroutine which reads the contents of an ADF11 file.

This collection of files has been extracted from ADAS. It is the recommended
that, for ADAS members, instead of using these subroutines you call the
pre-compiled ADAS libraries. Manual compilation is only recommended when
integration with non-standard compilers or operating systems (especially
parallel architectures) is required.
